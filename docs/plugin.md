## Loading plugins

If plugins are written as modules, once they are installed, they are enabled.

You can use configurations to disable some plugins:
```toml
[default]
plugins = ['no:pyppl_rich', 'no:pyppl_export']
```

You can also load plugins manually if they are written as a class object:
```python
from pyppl import config_plugins

# enable pyppl_rich, but disable pyppl_export
config_plugins('pyppl_rich', 'no:pyppl_export')
```

## Plugin hooks

The plugin system is implemented with [`pluggy`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pluggy)

See all available plugins APIs [here](https://pyppl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#pypplplugin).

## Entry point

You can register plugins by yourself using `pyppl.config_plugins`. However, if you want to expose your plugin to `PyPPL` by adding entrypoint to your `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml` or other equivalent packaging setting files:

For `setup.py`, you will need:
```python
setup(
	# ...
	entry_points={"pyppl": ["pyppl_report = pyppl_report"]},
	# ...
)
```

For `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.poetry.plugins.pyppl]
pyppl_report = "pyppl_report"
```
